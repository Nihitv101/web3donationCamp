npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@^2.0.0 @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle@^2.0.0 chai@^4.2.0 ethereum-waffle@^3.0.0 ethers@^5.0.0 hardhat@^2.8.4


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
