#   web3donation Application


The Web3 Donation Application is a project that combines React, Solidity, Hardhat, Ether.js, and Mocha Chai to create a decentralized platform for making and tracking donations. Users can connect their wallets to the application, allowing them to securely contribute funds through a provided form. The application utilizes Solidity smart contracts written and deployed with Hardhat to ensure the transparency and immutability of donation transactions. Each donation made by a user is recorded and displayed in a list, providing visibility into the impact of contributions. By leveraging Web3 technologies and blockchain, the project aims to provide a secure and transparent way for users to make donations and have a positive social impact.
